Create accumulator
Create List for totals
bool answer = true;


-- while(!answer) --

1)
Add to redis sorted set
Key: nameOfCrypto
Val: total

2)
store portfolio in redis hash
Key: nameOfCrypto
Val: JSON for portfolio struct


-- Do you want to enter another? = answer --


Get the reverse order of sorted set as list

Use returned list of cryptos to get the portfolio
struct from redis hash


Calculate %: (portfolio.total % accumulator) x 100
Round to 2 decimal places

update the % for the portfolio


Portfolio struct is complete
